## Project Information
- This is a recipe book site designed for college students to eat meals designed for them and be aware of what they are eating.
- This recipe book also has a lot of cool features: setting intolerances and cook time, webscrapping, favoriting and CRUD functionality.

## How to Run
- Click below for the most recent deployment.
- Enter in intolerances and preferred cook time (max time).
- If you want to change them, press the tag button to update preferences in the home page.
- Explore recipes on the home page or feel free to search for specific recipes.
- If users wish to create recipes they have two choices: manually or automatically from another site.
- Click the heart button on the top right of each recipe to favorite and save them into a dedicated favorites folder.
- Most importantly, have fun and enjoy your meal.

## Coding Conventions
- Followed standard JavaScript and Super Linter format
- Valididated HTML and CSS
- Kept everyone on the same page for formatting and code styling (from Code Climate)

## Branch Conventions
- Branch name: relavent to issue at hand (ex. Spoonacular API functions - API-branch)
- Followed kebab case naming convention
- Deleted branches once merged to main
- Kept main bug free
- Had multiple reviewers for code conflicts and testing of each branch before merging

- Added new issues with tags for specific issues
- Assigned to specific teams (ex. HTML issues go to frontend tag)
- Checked with CI/CD pipeline for failures
- Encouraged team members to create issues whenever a bug is found
