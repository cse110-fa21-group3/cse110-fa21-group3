  - FIGURE OUT A WAY TO GET THINGS DONE BEFORE TOO LATE
- **Becareful merging, don’t want to mess up functionality, need someone who knows both front end and back end to do that. **


## TODO (Ordered By Priority)
- **Need to work on DELETE recipes**
- At least have 2 **add-on features**. (Timer? Filtering? **User Preferences (first time, and calibrate)** IS REALLY GOOD ADD-ON)
  - Need another brainstorm meeting, and Figure out features we want to add.

- CI/CD Pipeline
- MAJOR TOPIC IN NEXT 2 weeks: 
  - Testing and refinement (**UNIT TESTING by next week**)
  - Allocate people to start testing. MAKE SURE to starting testing as soon as returning from thanksgiving
- Need to discuss whether to have update recipe?
  - Options: 1) Add a button to allow editing on user-created recipes. 2) Give user freedom to edit any recipes, go in recipes and change a few things.
- Scaling Ingredients and Nutritions by serving size desired by the user?
  - Toggle change serving size, also need to store it somewhere, next time they enter they get the latest changes.
  - Nutrition can be done like: nutrition per default serving size or do more math (ideally we want to scale that too)
  - **Be careful about scaring, metrics can be gnarly.**
- Need to Figure out deployment
- Create wiki, documentaion
- Clean up branches
- Pixel testing, SEO, lighthouse testing(LIGHTHOUSE tab IN DEV CONSOLE), etc.
- Charset encoding?
- **MAKE SURE NOT TO LOG ANYTHING TO THE CONSOLE in the final product!!!!!!!!!!!!!!**


## Other Notes:
- Sanat advised against major changes in the layout of the pages (meaning changes in HTML, NOT CSS)
- favorting and unfavoriting counts as update in CRUD
- Lab Grading:
  - If you submit lab 10, best 9 of 10 will be calculated, if you don’t do it, it’s still fine, your score will be calculated in 8 out of 9.
