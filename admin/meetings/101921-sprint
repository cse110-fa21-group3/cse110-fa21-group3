# Brainstorming Ideas:
- Web based application
- Features:
  - ranking popular recipes to make people more interested
  - recipe of the day 
  - possibly have a sidebar for list of recipes (a-z)
  - allow users to interact by adding/removing? 
  - login - log off system
  - favorite recipes: share to friends (link) 
  - like spotify: default favorite folders and also can create own folders (name it) 
  - save for later option
  - ingredients distinct and kind of seperate
  - filter recipes: by region, 
  - tag system: #peanuts, #wheat, #shellfood, #vegan, #vegetarian, etc
  - filter and tag system can be combined
  - user profile can set #nopeanuts, and food allergies
  - color blind transitions? 
  - possibly have voice step by step 
  - recipe page, how much time, and difficulty level (possibly add as a tag) 
  - comment section
  - sort by ingredients: only has some stuff in fridge
  - can show other similar recipes
  - fancy homepage with ranked recipes
  - can do something health related 
  - audio tutorial in the beginning for the steps
  - minimalist design
  - IO: can make it look like netflix, click then expand, name and picture of recipe 
  - simple timer on the page to make user not navigate the page
  - make recipe more interactive, such as check list for ingredients 
  - video of recipe being done (embed video) 
  - how are we getting recipes??? 
  - how many recipes should we have?
