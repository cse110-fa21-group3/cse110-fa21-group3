- There will be **Participation Quiz** during **In-person Discussions** (Time is still TBA i think)
- Brainstrom assignments will be out tonight or early morning tomorrow.
- ***Sanat suggests to come up with target audiences & user stories first before brainstorming features for them.***
- ***Need to narrow down the target users.
So have at least 5 user stories and pick only 1-2 out of all to target.***
- Went over each team's progress, there are 2 teams that already have a miro whiteboard with user stories and stuff. (I think that's gonna be on the assignments).
- Watched each team's branding video.
