## decisions:
- stick to class names for element sections
- class names are specific to the section so unique for each section
- for elements that backend will access should have unique id's 
- backend will let us know if they need more id's to access data sections
- updated the header with the correct logo and add to favorites icon
- backed out bootstrap and prefer to use vanilla CSS
- use validator as first test to check html
- use black for the background and gray for the foregrounf
- libre baskerville as the font for the pages
