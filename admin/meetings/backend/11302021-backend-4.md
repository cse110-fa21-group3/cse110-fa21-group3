# Backend Meeting 4

## Agenda

1. Take tasks off the project board - focus shift to issues and existing features. Let's polish what we have already
2. Make API key in `utilityFunctions.js` private - i.e. have to load it from somewhere? (post meeting: tabled for later when we deploy)
3. `fetchRecipes` has an offset but `getLocalStorageRecipes` doesn't? (post meeting: resolved)

## Action Items

1. Utility function that gets N random recipes (Nathan and Martin)
2. Alert for deleting (Ayushi)
3. Fix delete deletes everything (Parsia)
4. Figure out Heroku or Netlify (??)
5. If a summary doesn't exist, display nothing instead of "undefined" (Ayushi and Parsia)
6. Nutrition typo on create recipe page (Parsia)
