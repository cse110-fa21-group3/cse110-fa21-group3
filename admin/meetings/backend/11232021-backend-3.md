# Backend Meeting 3

## Agenda

* Action items

## Action Items

1. Delete recipe
   * Need a utility function to remove from localStorage (Martin and Nathan)
   * Need a button that's bound to that function with the recipe ID passed in (Ayushi and Parsia)
2. Edit recipes (Ayushi and Parsia)
   * Need a button that is bound to an event listener which can call the relevant utility functions for editing
   * Automatically updated in localStorage unless the name is changed
3. User preferences (Ayushi and Parsia)
   * Need a button on the homepage that is connected to `userData`, containing form data with the user's preferences
4. Get description (summary) and serves from Spoonacular recipes (Martin and Nathan)
5. URL fetching
   * Need a textbox for getting the URL, attached to an event listener in `createRecipe.js` which validates it and uses an utility to get the response (Ayushi and Parsia)
   * Need a utility function which fetches and parses the web page the user wants to pull a recipe from (Martin and Nathan)
   * May be a good opportunity for throwing a custom error from _the utility function_ for catching in the DOM function where it's used (lab 9)
   * Need a separate helper function to take all of the data from the response (i.e. after parsing) and set it as the values of the "Create Recipe" form (Ayushi and Parsia)

Leaving all other items mentioned by Sanat for next week as it's Fall Break in a couple days. We won't be able to finish any additional features (like ingredient scaling) before we get back.
