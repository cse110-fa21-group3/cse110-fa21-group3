Potential Search Ideas:
- Elastic Search
- Hash table
- Sets
- If there's not much latency, we don't have to swap ideas

Using Lab Code:
- It's fine but don't use code from styles.

JSDocs:
- You can create wiremill files and do our workflows like that.
- Host using github pages, becuase it's meant for documentation.
- The planner for the project isn;t as important, just github pages is not okay. Use Hiroku.

Spoonacular:
- Run in postman
- take a URL for the website, pass the website, look at the source code...
- If you're worried about webscraping, just use this API.
- Have the user enter a url, to scrape from and create a recipe.
- For the create recipe page: Add a url field to auto-populate create recipe.

Other notes:
- Tie in all the backend logic to the frontend templates and we basically have our mvp.
- Finish pipline as soon as possible, don't wait for the checkpoint. It will be easier to test code.
- More than 3 ADRs
- The average user would not try to access and tamper with local storage. Have backups.
- If you want to use github pages as a staging platform before Hiroku, that's fine.
- Don't use inline styling for css.
