## Attendance:
- Sanat

- Martin

## Dicussion
- Get the pitch done asap 
- brainstorming was done well
- design team should try to make more wireframes and complete it 
- starting pitch can be possibly done in one meeting
- For databases: will not get as much for databases
- no direct help/material 
- Sanat can help answer questions about databases but is limited
- databases are allowed
- where do we want to store the data (google drive or google cloud) (firebase) 
- can use firebase but will be overkill
- for storing the recipes (how many are we going to store at a given point) (dont need database, local storage) 
- json objects stored in text files (dumping in local storage, can store tens of thousands of recipes)
- functionality perspective: only need databases if we have multiple users creating at the same time (millions of recipes) 
- log in - add on feature
- user authentication - add on feature
- problem with user manually enter recipes: wont cut it
  - cannot expect user to store hundreds of recipes manually 
  - not feasible
  - whole point is having a lot of recipes so we can manage them
  - almost insignificant
  - not recipe management app
- should probably combine the two to first get hundreds of recipes and then let users add their own recipes
- really focus on the json data format
- if we have enough existing content, then should offset to manually enter and reenter recipes
- scrapping data will be the quickest and most convient and scalable for users
- as long as we can guarantee that there are enough recipes then we can do it
- if we get a huge dump of recipes thatll be best
- json can store tags
- can also open a browser in the app, then get source code of recipe, find json data, then get it to our app, then take the extracted data and then store on our app
- we need to keep this momentum up (currently doing very well)
- also need to finish up the wireframe and add workflow diagram
- need to be active on slack (include slack bot or stand up bot)
  - bot can receive daily stand up notes asynchronous
- divide teams into sub teams (groups of two)
- github project board (set it up)
- features are the issues and can be assigned to people
