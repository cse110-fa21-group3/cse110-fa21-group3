# Notes
- CodeFactor.io (autorize on the repo), it will allow you to automatically correct all the errors
- All files are supposed to run through the linter
- Favorites button has a toggling bug, update the UI on the favorites page card
- Structure of the UI will mostly stay the same, we are adding more recipes and might add card summaries
- When more recipes are added, cards on the homepage are too small. Using grid or flexbox will likely solve this.
- Functionality-wise, everything but the favorites bug and the url web scraper works
- Try to make the recipe page more compact, remove the dead space
- Deploy as soon as possible to run into errors early
- Add a badge for coverage, build-status
- README: add info about the project, how to run the source code, how to install npm packages, branch conventions, issue tracking, etc.
- The wiki is meant to host the documentation, it is a repo in a repo(copy md files and paste in the wiki pages)
- Can automatically push to pages in the wiki
- Can add the team page, values, etc. to the wiki
- Take a screenshot of the current branches and paste them in the README to document our branching process
- Condense the css files into one styles file
- On main, and other branches, delete any unused files
- For testing, any DOM related things are additional
- Test functions that manipulate local storage(might have to test the DOM)
- Run lighthouse in incognito(turn off chrome extensions)
