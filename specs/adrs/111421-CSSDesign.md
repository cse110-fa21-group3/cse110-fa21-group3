# CSS Styling: Vanilla vs Library Winner: Bootstrap (Library)

* Status: accepted
* Deciders: Front end team
* Date: 11/10/21

## Context and Problem Statement
- Front end team was deciding on how to style the HTML templates by either using Bootstrap or with Vanilla CSS. This was something that would affect all the pages so the entire team had a discussion about this. 

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->
* Time Restraints
* Experience with Vanilla vs Bootstrap (learning curve is same for both)

## Considered Options
* Bootstrap
* Vanilla (Plain)

## Decision Outcome
- We chose to mainly do Bootstrap and focus on using the Bootstrap library for styling though we will implement some vanilla CSS 

### Positive Consequences 
* Faster Development (ideally)
* Some of the team is experienced (bigger bus factor) 
* Well documented

### Negative Consequences <!-- optional -->
* Adding a lot of classes to each of the HTML elements (could be messy)
* Some people have to learn it 
* Don't have as much control compared to plain CSS

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- optional -->

### Vanilla CSS
{Lab 2 | very simple CSS | https://www.w3schools.com/css/ }

* Good, because universal and simple
* Good, because everybody has experience because of the labs
* Bad, because takes a lot of time to learn and fully understand whats going on

### Bootstrap Library
{CSS Library | Library for styling HTML elements | https://getbootstrap.com/ } 

* Good, because has a lot of tools and formating
* Good, because easy to learn
* Good, because takes a lot less time to implement
* Bad, because limited control by developers.
