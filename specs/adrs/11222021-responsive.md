## Context and Problem Statement

There are many ways to access a webpage nowadays, such as through a mobile device, a tablet, a desktop, etc. Given the time constraints we have and the consideration
of fitting the webpage into different screen sizes, should we make the application responsive or not?

## Considered Options

1. Make the page layout responsive to fit different sizes of screens
2. Make the page layout static to fit a fixed size of screen

## Decision Outcome

Decided on option 1, since our user demographic stems from young adults to elderly, there will be a great amount of individuals who will access this application through their
phones and desktops depending on their age range and their personal preference.

## Pros and Cons

### Responsive Layout

* Good, the page layout can adjust to multiple types of screen so the app can service more users from different devices
* Bad, takes more time to design an alternate layout for other screen sizes, as well as, develop and test those layouts
* Good, can transition our web based application into a mobile application more easily, lower maintenance needs
* Good, improve user experience

### Static Layout

* Good, development becomes easier and quicker, since there is only one screen size to worry about and adjust to
* Bad, page content will become unorganized or even unviewable if the user decides to access the application through a different size screen
* Bad, decrease user experience and increase bounce rate
